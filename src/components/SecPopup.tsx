        Investment in a token sale entails risks of a partial or complete loss
        of the investment. No guarantee is given regarding the liquidity of the
        tokens acquired in the offering, the existence of a secondary market for
        said tokens, the value of the tokens acquired in the offering and the
        exchange value of said tokens in legal currency. Tokens do not
        constitute financial instruments or securities tokens and confer no
        other right than those described in the litepaper. In addition, the
        regulatory framework applicable to the offering and to the tokens as
        well as the tax regime applicable to the holding of tokens are not
